## Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

In this repository, the major task is a research project on employees of a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

We will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database(Postgres), and answer questions about the data. The two major tasks are:

1. Data Engineering/Data Modeling

2. Data Analysis

<h4 style="color:#F09789">Data Modeling</h4>

Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. We use the <a href="https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/" target="_blank" style="color:#6990A4">Quick Database Diagrams</a>.
